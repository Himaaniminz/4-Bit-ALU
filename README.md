# 4-Bit-ALU
This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing basic arithmetic and logic operations. The ALU is designed using digital logic principles and can be simulated using tools like CircuitVerse or other digital design platforms.
Components: bcd to 7 segment decoder, 4:1 mux, parallel full adder/subtractor, logic gates
